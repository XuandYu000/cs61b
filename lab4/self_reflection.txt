All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: I should create a new method in my Node class so that I can make the Insert methods clear. 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I tried my best to make my code clear and elegant.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: In the ArrayDeque.java, sometimes, I even couldn't understand the code even though I pass the test.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: The pointers, front and tail, have different means in the ArrayDeque. After learning that, I found that it's easy to code.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: As the question above one.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I will try to think a different way to resize the array in a smarter way.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: I needn't add a pointer which points to the tail of the List beacause the front of the sentinel is the tail of the List.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: In my code, I clarified the order of adding and deleting nodes in a doubly linked list.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Maybe there is a better way to the constractor.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A: As the first problem above.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: 

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A:

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A:
